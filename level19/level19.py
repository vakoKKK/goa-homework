            <h3>What an ecology?</h3>
            <p>Ecology (from ancient Greek οἶκος - dwelling (house), residence and λόγος - study[1])<br>
                 is a natural science (section of biology) about the interactions of living organisms with each other<br>
                and with their habitat, about the organization and functioning of biosystems at various levels<br>
                 (populations, communities, ecosystems)[2].

                In common parlance, ecology is often understood as the state of the environment, and environmental <br>
                problems are issues of protecting the environment from the influence of anthropogenic factors [3][4][5].<br>
                 Ecologism is a social movement for strengthening environmental protection measures and for preventing<br>
                  habitat destruction</p>

                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>The Encyclopedia Britannica considers the work of ancient Greek naturalists, primarily Theophrastus,<br>
                     who described the relationships of organisms with each other and with the surrounding inanimate<br>
                      nature, as the first origins of ecology as a science. This field of science was further developed by<br>
                       early researchers of plant and animal physiology[6].</p>

                <p>One of the key components of ecology as a science, the concept of an ecological pyramid, intuitively<br>
                     formulated by the medieval Arab thinker Al-Jahiz, was reflected in 1881 in the work of <br>
                     K. Semper “The Impact of Natural Conditions of Existence on Animal Life,” which is considered<br>
                      one of the earliest studies of redistribution energy in nature[7].</p>

                <p>The term “ecology” (German: Ökologie) was introduced in 1866 by the German biologist E. G. Haeckel.<br>
                     In the book “General Morphology of Organisms,” he wrote about ecology as a science that studies<br>
                      the relationships between living and inanimate nature[8]. In 1896,<br>
                       the German “Textbook of Ecological Geography of Plants: An Introduction to the Knowledge<br>
                        of Plant Communities” was published [9].</p>

                <p>American zoologist S. A. Forbes [English] in 1895 defined ecology as the science of the<br>
                     relationships of animals and plants to other living beings and to everything around them.<br>
                      Partial or complete synonyms for the concept of “ecology” were “ethology”<br>
                       (defined by I. Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire as the science of the relationships of organisms<br>
                        in the family and community), and “hexicology” (English hexicology), which Saint-George Jackson Mivart<br>
                        in 1894 defined as the science of the relationship between organisms and the environment[10].<br>
                         In the second half of the century, the concepts of “biosphere” (E. Suess, 1875) and “biocenosis”<br>
                          (K. A. Mobius, 1877) were also introduced into use [11].</p>

                <p>A. Tansley introduced the term “ecosystem” in 1935, and V. N. Sukachev 5 years later introduced the term “biogeocenosis”[2].</p>

                <h3>Science</h3>
                <p>Ecology as a science began to be institutionalized in the second decade of the 20th century<br>
                     with the formation of the British Ecological Society in 1913, and the Ecological Society of America<br>
                      in 1915[10]. Since 1913, the Journal of Ecology, the first international peer-reviewed scientific<br>
                       journal in this field, began publishing in Great Britain[12]. In the first half of the 20th century,<br>
                        research on plant communities in Europe and America was carried out in different directions.
                         Europeans first were interested in the composition, structure and distribution of plant<br>
                          communities, while American botanists were concerned with the development (succession) of such<br>
                           communities. Research into the ecology of the animal world was carried out separately until<br>
                           American biologists shifted their emphasis, turning to the study of the interaction of plant<br>
                            and animal communities as single biotas[6]. The idea that ecology as a science should deal<br>
                             simultaneously with plant and animal communities was first expressed in 1913 by C. K. Adams<br>
                              in his book “A Guide to the Study of Animal Ecology”[12].</p>
                
                <p>In 1926, V.I. Vernadsky gave a modern definition of the concept of the biosphere (as the totality of all ecosystems) and noted the human influence on this system[13]. During the same period, interest in population dynamics increased, and mathematical models of population processes (among the authors are R. Pearl, A. Lotka, V. Volterra) began to be used in studies of the relationships between predators and prey, interspecific competition and natural regulation of population numbers[6] .</p>
